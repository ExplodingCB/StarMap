# ✨ Multi-Stop Waypoint System - COMPLETE!

## 🎉 The "+ Add stop" Button Now Works!

You can now create complex multi-stop routes through the Local Group, just like Google Maps!

---

## 🚀 How to Use Waypoints

### Step-by-Step

1. **Start a route**
   - Click any galaxy (e.g., Milky Way)
   - Click "Directions"
   - Origin is set

2. **Click "+ Add stop"**
   - New waypoint field appears between origin and destination
   - Shows numbered dot (1, 2, 3...)

3. **Type waypoint galaxy**
   - Search results appear
   - Click a galaxy (e.g., "LMC")

4. **Add more stops** (optional)
   - Click "+ Add stop" again
   - Add another waypoint (e.g., "Triangulum")

5. **Set destination**
   - Type in destination field
   - Click a galaxy (e.g., "Andromeda")

6. **Route calculates!**
   - Shows path: Milky Way → LMC → Triangulum → Andromeda
   - Total distance and time calculated
   - Visual path on 3D map

## 🎯 Example Routes to Try

### Simple 2-Stop
```
Origin: Milky Way
Destination: Andromeda
Result: Direct route (770 kpc)
```

### 3-Stop Tour
```
Origin: Milky Way
Stop 1: LMC
Destination: Andromeda
Result: MW → LMC → Andromeda
```

### Grand Tour (5 stops!)
```
Origin: Milky Way
Stop 1: LMC
Stop 2: SMC
Stop 3: Triangulum
Destination: Andromeda
Result: Epic journey across Local Group!
```

## 🎨 Waypoint Interface

### Visual Indicators

| Position | Indicator | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Origin** | Blue dot (●) | Starting point |
| **Stop 1** | White circle with "1" | First waypoint |
| **Stop 2** | White circle with "2" | Second waypoint |
| **Stop 3** | White circle with "3" | Third waypoint |
| **Destination** | Red marker (▼) | End point |

### Input Fields Order
```
● [Milky Way        ]  ← Origin
① [LMC             ] ✕  ← Waypoint 1
② [Triangulum      ] ✕  ← Waypoint 2
▼ [Andromeda       ]  ← Destination
  + Add stop          ← Add more
```

### Waypoint Features
- **Numbered dots**: 1, 2, 3... (unlimited!)
- **Search**: Type to search, click result
- **Remove**: X button on each waypoint
- **Reorder**: (Future feature)
- **Dynamic**: Add/remove anytime

---

## 🧮 Route Calculation

### Direct Route (No Waypoints)
```
findDirectPath(start, end)
→ Straight line
→ Fastest route
```

### Multi-Waypoint Route
```
findPathWithWaypoints([start, wp1, wp2, ..., end])
→ Calculates segments: start→wp1, wp1→wp2, ... wpN→end
→ Sums total distance
→ Shows all steps
```

### Algorithm
Uses Dijkstra's shortest path for each segment:
- `Milky Way → LMC`: 50 kpc
- `LMC → Triangulum`: ~870 kpc
- `Triangulum → Andromeda`: ~100 kpc
- **Total**: ~1,020 kpc

---

## 📊 Route Display

### With Waypoints
Shows each stop in order:
```
Ⓐ Milky Way (SBbc)
① LMC (Irr)
② Triangulum (Sc)
Ⓑ Andromeda (Sb)
```

### Statistics Update
- **Distance**: Total of all segments
- **Time**: Based on total distance & speed
- **Waypoints**: Now accurate count (4 in example above)

## 🎮 Interaction Flow

1. **Click "+ Add stop"**
   → New field appears between origin and destination
   → Shows numbered circle (1)

2. **Type waypoint name**
   → Search results dropdown appears
   → Shows matching galaxies

3. **Click a result**
   → Waypoint is set
   → Route recalculates through new stop
   → Map updates with new path

4. **Add another stop**
   → Click "+ Add stop" again
   → New field shows number 2
   → Add another galaxy

5. **Remove a stop**
   → Click X button on waypoint
   → Waypoint removed
   → Route recalculates without it
