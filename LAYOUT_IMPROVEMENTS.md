# 🎨 Layout Improvements

## Changes Made

### ✅ Removed Gray Overlay
**Before**: Opening search panel grayed out the entire app  
**After**: Search panel opens cleanly without overlay  
**Why**: Less intrusive, allows viewing the 3D map while searching

### ✅ Moved Galaxy Types Legend to Right
**Before**: Legend on left side, cluttered with search button  
**After**: Legend on right side, clean separation  
**Location**: Top-right (below title area)

### ✅ Fixed Title Overlap
**Before**: Search button covered "Nearest Planet" title  
**After**: Clean layout with proper spacing  
**Changes**:
- Title moved to `left: 80px` (gives space for search button)
- Search button at `left: 20px, top: 80px` (below title)

### ✅ Improved Z-Index Hierarchy
**Layers** (back to front):
- Base layer: 3D scene
- 999: Title
- 1000: Legend
- 1050: Search panel
- 1100: Info panel, Search button, Controls
